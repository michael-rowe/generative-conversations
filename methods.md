# Methods

This discussion document was developed through a multi-phase process that engaged the international physiotherapy community before, during, and after the 2024 IFOMPT conference.

**Pre-conference survey**: We conducted an initial survey across 16 countries to gather preliminary thoughts on generative AI in physiotherapy, identifying key areas of interest and concern from within the international professional community.

**In-conference survey**: Building on the insights derived from the pre-conference survey, we implemented a more comprehensive follow-up survey during the week of the conference, exploring participants' perceptions of AI across various aspects of physiotherapy practice, education, and research.

**Pre-conference workshop**: A full-day workshop before the main conference featured small group discussions, informed by the workshop facilitators' personal and professional experiences with AI, as well as the survey responses, exploring the implications of AI in clinical practice, education, and research.

**Community consultation**: Following the workshop, we created a draft discussion document that was shared publicly, and promoted via social media channels, to solicit input and feedback. We also invited specific colleagues who had expressed interest in the topic.

**Synthesis and analysis**: Information collected from all these activities was synthesised to identify key themes, opportunities, risks, and strategies related to AI integration in physiotherapy. Unsurprisingly, we used AI as part of the synthesis process.

**Iterative refinement**: The document underwent several rounds of review and revision, incorporating feedback from workshop participants and stakeholders to ensure comprehensive coverage.

This collaborative approach captured diverse perspectives from physiotherapy professionals, educators, researchers, and AI experts, providing a robust foundation for discussion about generative AI in physiotherapy.
