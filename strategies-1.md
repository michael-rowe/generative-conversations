# Strategies

Successfully incorporating AI into physiotherapy education requires deliberate approaches that maximise learning benefits while addressing potential challenges. These strategies focus on curriculum development, teaching methodologies, ethical frameworks, faculty preparation, and ongoing evaluation to ensure AI tools enhance rather than diminish educational quality. By implementing thoughtful integration methods, physiotherapy educators can harness AI's capabilities to create more effective learning experiences while preserving the essential human elements and hands-on skills that remain fundamental to the profession.

The following strategies provide a foundation for responsibly incorporating AI into educational settings while mitigating associated risks.

***

#### Faculty development programmes

Ensuring educators are well-prepared to integrate AI effectively is crucial for successful implementation.

* Design comprehensive training programmes for faculty on AI tools and pedagogical applications
* Provide ongoing support and resources for educators implementing AI in their teaching
* Create collaborative learning opportunities for faculty to share experiences and best practices
* Establish mentoring systems to support educators in AI integration

#### Integrated AI literacy curriculum

Comprehensive AI education must be woven throughout the physiotherapy curriculum to ensure effective and ethical use of AI tools.

* Develop systematic training programs covering technical skills, critical evaluation, and ethical considerations
* Structure regular curriculum updates to keep pace with evolving AI technologies and applications
* Create practical learning modules demonstrating appropriate AI use in various educational contexts
* Maintain ongoing assessment of AI literacy development throughout the program

#### Blended learning approaches

Creating effective combinations of AI-enhanced digital learning with traditional teaching methods is essential for balanced education.

* Design hybrid learning environments that integrate AI tools with hands-on practical sessions
* Establish clear frameworks for when to use AI-enhanced versus traditional teaching methods
* Create opportunities for students to practice clinical skills in both virtual and physical settings
* Develop assessment methods that evaluate both AI-assisted and traditional learning outcomes

#### Ethical guidelines and best practices

Clear frameworks for ethical AI use in education are crucial for maintaining academic integrity and professional standards.

* Establish comprehensive guidelines and standards for AI use in assessment tasks, practical work in different educational contexts
* Create detailed protocols for maintaining academic integrity in an AI-enhanced learning environment
* Implement regular review processes to update guidelines as AI capabilities evolve

#### Continuous evaluation and research

Regular assessment of AI's impact on educational outcomes is essential for effective implementation.

* Implement systematic evaluation of AI's effect on learning outcomes and skill development
* Create frameworks for gathering and analysing student and faculty feedback on AI integration
* Conduct ongoing research into the effectiveness of different AI-enhanced teaching methods
* Maintain regular assessment of the balance between AI-enhanced and traditional learning
