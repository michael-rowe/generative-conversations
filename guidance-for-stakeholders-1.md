# Guidance for stakeholders

The integration of AI into physiotherapy education affects various stakeholders differently, so we offer a range of options below.

Note that there is some repetition in this guidance across domains of practice. We have collated the guidance from each section of the document into a [table for easy reference](synthesis/synthesised-core-guidance.md).
