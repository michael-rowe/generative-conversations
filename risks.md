# Risks

As educational institutions increasingly adopt AI technologies, it is essential to consider the potential challenges these tools may present to physiotherapy education. These concerns range from impacts on student skill development and academic integrity to questions of educational equity and the preservation of human connection in learning environments. Understanding these risks is crucial for educators to implement AI tools in ways that enhance rather than undermine the quality of physiotherapy education. By acknowledging potential downsides, educational programs can develop approaches that leverage AI's benefits while protecting the core values and competencies that define the profession.

***

#### Over-reliance on AI and loss of critical thinking

The increasing integration of AI tools into education may compromise students' development of independent reasoning abilities.

* Risk of students becoming overly dependent on AI-generated solutions and sourced information, potentially undermining their ability to develop robust clinical reasoning skills and data literacy
* Decreased engagement with complex problem-solving when AI provides quick answers without deeper understanding
* Challenge of maintaining critical thinking development when AI tools offer convenient shortcuts to learning
* Potential erosion of students' confidence in their own judgement when constantly comparing with AI outputs or when AI tools are not available

#### Decreased hands-on skills development

The shift towards AI-enhanced virtual learning environments may reduce essential practical training opportunities.

* Risk of reduced time spent on physical assessment and manual therapy skill development due to increased focus on digital learning
* Potential overemphasis on virtual simulations at the expense of real hands-on practice sessions
* Challenge of maintaining appropriate balance between technology-enhanced learning and essential physical skill development
* Concern about graduates' preparedness for hands-on clinical work in real-world settings

#### Ethical concerns and academic integrity

The integration of AI raises significant challenges regarding assessment authenticity and learning validation.

* Growing difficulty in verifying genuine student work versus AI-generated content in assignments
* Challenge of developing authentic assessment methods that accurately evaluate student knowledge and skills
* Risk of students bypassing essential cognitive and learning processes by using AI to complete assignments
* Need for new frameworks to maintain academic integrity while acknowledging AI's role in education

#### Widening digital divide

Unequal access to AI technologies may create or exacerbate educational disparities.

* Risk of creating two-tier education systems between institutions with and without advanced AI capabilities
* Potential disadvantage for students from resource-limited backgrounds or regions
* Challenge of ensuring equitable access to AI-enhanced learning opportunities across different settings
* Impact on global physiotherapy education standards and qualification comparability

#### Depersonalisation of education

Increased reliance on AI tools may reduce crucial human interactions in the learning process.

* Risk of diminishing valuable mentor-student relationships that foster professional development
* Potential loss of peer-to-peer learning opportunities that contribute to clinical reasoning development
* Challenge of maintaining effective professional socialisation in increasingly digital environments
* Impact on development of essential communication and interpersonal skills
* Risk of student isolation and reduced peer interaction if AI becomes the primary source of feedback and guidance

## Discussion questions on the risks of integrating AI into physiotherapy education

1. How can we ensure that the use of AI in physiotherapy education enhances rather than hinders the development of critical thinking and clinical reasoning skills?
2. What balance should be struck between AI-enhanced learning and traditional hands-on skills development in physiotherapy education?
3. How can we address concerns about academic integrity and ensure fair assessment in an AI-enhanced learning environment?
4. What measures can be taken to ensure equitable access to AI educational tools across different institutions and student populations? Is this even possible?
5. How can we maintain the human element and professional socialisation in physiotherapy education while integrating AI technologies?
6. How can educational institutions develop robust policies to address AI-related ethical challenges while maintaining academic standards?
7. What strategies can be implemented to ensure AI tools complement rather than replace traditional mentorship and peer learning?
8. How might the integration of AI impact international recognition and accreditation of physiotherapy qualifications?
9. What role - if any - should professional bodies play in guiding the implementation of AI in physiotherapy education?
