### Developing AI literacy and skills

All physiotherapy professionals should develop foundational AI literacy to understand AI capabilities, applications, and limitations. This includes the ability to critically evaluate AI outputs, recognise potential biases, and understand how AI-generated recommendations fit within established physiotherapy practice. Continuous professional development in AI applications will be essential as these technologies evolve. Organisations should support structured training opportunities while individuals cultivate curiosity about emerging technologies.

### Balancing AI and human expertise

AI should complement, not replace, human expertise. Maintain strong clinical reasoning, hands-on skills, and independent judgement while leveraging AI as a supportive tool. The therapeutic relationship and human touch remain central to physiotherapy practice. Focus on using AI to enhance efficiency in appropriate areas, so more time can be devoted to aspects of care that require human skills. Mentoring relationships should emphasise this balance, with experienced practitioners guiding how to integrate AI tools while preserving core physiotherapy competencies.

### Critical evaluation and reflection

Adopt a reflective approach to AI integration, critically assessing AI recommendations and outputs before implementation. Foster a culture of thoughtful evaluation that weighs AI suggestions against clinical expertise, research evidence, and patient needs. Encourage regular reflection on how AI is changing practice patterns, and ensure that professional judgement remains the final authority in decision-making processes. Document reasoning when accepting or rejecting AI recommendations in clinical, educational, or research contexts.

### Ethical use and governance

Prioritise ethical considerations in AI adoption, including patient privacy, informed consent, and data security. Be transparent with patients, students, and research participants about AI use. Develop clear policies for appropriate AI implementation that align with professional values and standards. Consider implications for equity and access, ensuring AI doesn't exacerbate existing healthcare disparities. Establish ethical review processes for AI applications, particularly when handling sensitive data or making significant decisions.

### Policy development and standards

Develop comprehensive policies, guidelines, and standards for responsible AI use in physiotherapy. Professional organisations should create position statements and ethical frameworks to guide implementation. Regulatory bodies should establish adaptive frameworks that address AI-related risks without stifling innovation. Educational programs need clear policies on AI use in assessment, while research requires transparent reporting standards for AI methods. All policies should be regularly updated to reflect technological advancements.

### Ensuring equitable access

Work to ensure equitable access to AI tools across different settings, preventing digital divides between well-resourced and under-resourced institutions or practices. Consider how AI implementation might affect various patient populations differently, and develop strategies to maintain equitable care. In education, ensure all students have equal opportunities to develop AI competencies, regardless of their technological background. Research funding should support diverse settings to prevent AI capabilities becoming concentrated only in elite institutions.

### Sustainability of AI use

Consider both ecological and resource sustainability in AI implementation. Be mindful of the environmental impact of high-compute AI systems, especially when deployed at scale. Develop policies that promote energy-efficient AI use and consider the carbon footprint of different applications. From a human resource perspective, ensure AI integration doesn't lead to staff burnout through implementation fatigue or constant technological change. Create sustainable adoption models that consider workforce well-being, allowing adequate time for adaptation and learning. Balance technological advancement with sustainable workloads and realistic implementation timelines.
