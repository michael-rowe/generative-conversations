# Looking ahead

The integration of generative AI into physiotherapy practice, education, and research represents not just a technological evolution but a transformative opportunity to reimagine the profession itself. As we look to the future, it is clear that services, organisations and institutions where physiotherapists work will not simply adopt new tools but will fundamentally reconsider its approaches, priorities, and values in response to these emerging capabilities.

While technological advancements will undoubtedly continue to accelerate, offering increasingly sophisticated AI applications, the most significant developments will occur at the intersection of technology and human practice. The physiotherapy of tomorrow will be defined not by the capabilities of AI, but by how physiotherapists choose to integrate these systems into a holistic vision of care that remains deeply human-centred.

#### Redefining professional identity and core competencies

Physiotherapists will need to reconceptualise their professional identity, balancing technical expertise with uniquely human capabilities. The future practitioner will be distinguished not merely by clinical knowledge, which AI may increasingly share, but by interpersonal skills, ethical judgement, creative problem-solving, and cultural sensitivity that remain distinctively human. Educational programs will need to evolve accordingly, emphasising these human capabilities alongside technical competence and AI literacy.

#### Creating new models of collaborative practice

Future practice models will likely feature more sophisticated human-AI collaboration, with clear frameworks for determining when and how to leverage technological assistance. This may include AI-enhanced triage systems, diagnostic support, treatment planning tools, and monitoring mechanisms that operate under human supervision. Successful models will preserve practitioner autonomy and clinical judgement while leveraging AI to enhance efficiency and effectiveness.

#### Advancing equitable and accessible care

As AI becomes more integrated into physiotherapy, the profession has an unprecedented opportunity to address long-standing healthcare disparities. Future practice should deliberately leverage AI to extend high-quality care to under-served populations, whether through telehealth applications, culturally responsive treatment algorithms, or resource optimisation. However, this will require vigilance to ensure that AI implementation doesn't inadvertently create new forms of exclusion or reinforce existing biases.

#### Embracing continuous adaptation and learning

The rapid evolution of AI technologies will necessitate a profession that values continuous learning and adaptation. Future physiotherapists will need to regularly update their understanding of available tools, critically evaluate new developments, and flexibly incorporate beneficial innovations. Professional organisations will play a crucial role in supporting this adaptation through evolving standards, continuing education, and guidance on best practices.

#### Establishing ethical frameworks and governance

As AI assumes greater importance in physiotherapy, robust ethical frameworks and governance mechanisms will become essential. The profession will need to develop consensus around questions of liability, privacy, consent, and appropriate boundaries of AI use. Regulatory approaches should balance patient protection with the flexibility needed to realise AI's potential benefits, and may include approaches such as regulatory sandboxes, tiered oversight based on risk, and mandatory transparency requirements.

#### Fostering interdisciplinary collaboration

Future physiotherapy practice will likely feature deeper collaboration across disciplines, as AI integration challenges traditional professional boundaries. Meaningful advancement will require partnerships between physiotherapists, data scientists, ethicists, patient advocates, and other stakeholders to ensure that technological development remains grounded in clinical needs and human values. This collaboration may lead to novel research methodologies, innovative care delivery models, and more integrated approaches to complex health challenges.

#### Balancing efficiency with human connection

Perhaps the most fundamental challenge ahead will be maintaining the essential human connection at the heart of physiotherapy while embracing the efficiencies that AI offers. Future practice models must deliberately preserve space for empathy, presence, and therapeutic relationship-building, even as routine tasks become increasingly automated. This may require explicit strategies to prevent technology from becoming a barrier between practitioner and patient.
