# Strategies

The responsible integration of AI into physiotherapy research requires thoughtful approaches that maximise analytical benefits while addressing potential challenges. These strategies focus on researcher education, collaborative development, ethical guidelines, transparency initiatives, and continuous evaluation to ensure AI enhances research quality without compromising scientific integrity. By implementing comprehensive frameworks for AI adoption, the physiotherapy research community can leverage these powerful tools to advance knowledge while maintaining rigorous standards and preserving the human insight that remains essential to meaningful scientific inquiry.

The following strategies provide a foundation for effectively incorporating AI into research practices while mitigating associated risks.

#### Comprehensive AI training for researchers

Equipping physiotherapy researchers with robust AI literacy is fundamental to ensuring responsible and effective use of these technologies.

* Develop comprehensive training programs covering technical skills, critical evaluation, and ethical considerations
* Implement education on AI's limitations to ensure appropriate application and interpretation
* Include instruction on recognising and addressing potential biases in AI systems
* Maintain ongoing professional development as AI technologies evolve

#### Collaborative AI development

Partnerships between physiotherapy experts and AI specialists can lead to more effective and field-specific AI tools.

* Foster collaboration between physiotherapy researchers and AI experts to develop specialised tools
* Ensure AI development includes a deep understanding of physiotherapy research nuances and requirements
* Create interdisciplinary teams to address complex research challenges
* Leverage complementary expertise to optimise AI applications for physiotherapy contexts

#### Ethical guidelines and best practices

Clear frameworks for ethical AI use are essential to responsible research implementation.

* Develop specific ethical guidelines addressing data privacy, informed consent, and transparency
* Establish standards for mitigating AI bias in physiotherapy research
* Implement regular review processes to update guidelines as AI capabilities evolve

#### Open science and transparency initiatives

Promoting openness in AI-enhanced research supports reproducibility and scientific integrity.

* Make AI models and training data publicly available when possible
* Provide detailed descriptions of AI methodologies used in research
* Support open access to AI-enhanced research findings
* Create standards for documenting AI processes in sufficient detail for replication

#### Continuous evaluation and adaptation

Ongoing assessment of AI's impact ensures its integration supports rather than hinders research quality.

* Implement systematic evaluation of both benefits and drawbacks of AI use in research
* Use findings to refine AI integration approaches
* Monitor for unintended consequences of AI adoption
* Develop metrics to assess AI's contribution to research outcomes and quality
