# Introduction



The integration of generative AI into physiotherapy research opens up a new frontier of possibilities, promising to revolutionise the way we conduct studies, analyse data, and communicate findings. This technological advancement offers exciting opportunities to accelerate the pace of discovery, enhance the depth and breadth of our investigations, and uncover insights that might otherwise remain hidden. AI's capacity for rapid literature review, complex data analysis, and even hypothesis generation has the potential to significantly boost research productivity and innovation.

However, as we embrace these powerful tools, we must also grapple with important challenges. Questions of research integrity, data privacy, and the potential for AI-induced bias demand our careful consideration. Moreover, the integration of AI into research processes raises important ethical considerations and may exacerbate existing inequalities in research capabilities. As we chart this new course, it is crucial that we develop strategies to harness the benefits of AI while maintaining the rigour, creativity, and human insight that are fundamental to high-quality research in physiotherapy.

## AI in research: Key takeaways

1. Balanced integration is essential: AI offers powerful capabilities to enhance research efficiency and insight, but must be implemented as a complement to human creativity and critical thinking rather than a replacement for these fundamental research skills.
2. Data quality and bias awareness are critical: The quality of AI-enhanced research outputs depends heavily on the quality and diversity of input data; researchers must actively identify and mitigate potential biases to ensure findings are applicable across diverse populations.
3. Transparency and reproducibility must be prioritised: Detailed documentation of AI methodologies, models, and training data is necessary to maintain scientific rigour, enable study reproduction, and address the "black box" problem of AI decision-making.
4. Collaborative expertise drives innovation: The most effective AI research applications emerge from interdisciplinary collaboration between physiotherapy researchers, data scientists, patient/consumers and AI experts who understand both the technological possibilities and clinical nuances.
5. Ethical frameworks need continuous evolution: As AI capabilities advance, ethical guidelines must continually develop to address emerging concerns around data privacy, consent, equitable access, sustainable use, and the potential impacts of AI on the research ecosystem.
