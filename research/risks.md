# Risks

While AI presents significant opportunities for advancing physiotherapy research, it also introduces important challenges that require careful consideration. These potential concerns span from impacts on researcher capabilities and data integrity to questions of reproducibility and research equity across different contexts. Understanding these risks is essential for researchers to implement AI tools responsibly while maintaining the scientific rigour and ethical standards that underpin quality research. By acknowledging these challenges proactively, the physiotherapy research community can develop approaches that harness AI's analytical power while safeguarding against its potential limitations and unintended consequences.

***

#### Over-reliance on AI and loss of human insight

Excessive dependence on AI technologies may compromise the essential creative and intuitive aspects of the research process.

* Risk of researchers, especially early career researchers, becoming overly dependent on AI tools, potentially undermining their ability to think critically about research problems
* Decreased value placed on intuition and creativity that might lead to breakthrough discoveries
* Potential loss of confidence in independent judgement when constantly comparing with AI outputs
* Erosion of critical thinking skills through excessive reliance on AI-generated insights

#### Bias in AI systems

AI systems can perpetuate and [amplify existing biases](#user-content-fn-1)[^1], leading to research outcomes that may not be applicable across diverse populations.

* Inadvertent perpetuation of biases present in training data, favouring dominant groups
* Skewed research outcomes if researchers aren't aware of embedded biases
* Risk of generating hypotheses or analyses that aren't applicable to underrepresented populations
* Limited applicability of findings when AI is trained primarily on research involving certain demographic groups

#### Reproducibility and transparency issues

The complex nature of AI systems can create significant challenges in verifying and replicating research findings.

* Difficulties in replicating studies when AI decision-making processes aren't fully understood or explainable
* "Black box" problem undermining the credibility of research findings
* Challenges in validating results when the AI's methods aren't transparent
* Potential erosion of scientific rigour if AI processes can't be adequately explained

#### Ethical concerns in data use

The use of AI in research raises important questions about patient data privacy and appropriate consent.

* Ethical concerns regarding data privacy and consent when using large datasets
* Potential misuse of patient data for purposes beyond original consent parameters
* Issues around using sensitive patient information for AI training
* Challenges in maintaining appropriate boundaries for data use as AI capabilities evolve

#### Widening research capability gap

Unequal access to AI technologies may exacerbate existing inequalities in research capabilities.

* Risk of creating or worsening inequalities between well-funded and under-resourced institutions
* Limited access to advanced AI technologies for some researchers or institutions
* Potential concentration of cutting-edge AI-enhanced research in wealthy institutions
* Implications for global research equity when advanced technologies aren't universally available

## Discussion questions on the risks of integrating AI into physiotherapy research

1. How can we ensure that the use of AI in physiotherapy research enhances rather than replaces human creativity and insight?
2. What measures can be taken to identify and mitigate potential biases in AI systems used for research?
3. How can we address issues of reproducibility and transparency when using AI in physiotherapy research?
4. What ethical guidelines should govern the use of patient data in AI-enhanced physiotherapy research?
5. How can we ensure equitable access to AI research tools across different institutions and research groups?
6. How can we promote the sustainable use of AI in physiotherapy research, considering environmental impact, resource use, and long-term accessibility?
7. What standards should be developed for validating AI-assisted research methodologies in physiotherapy?
8. How can researchers balance the efficiency of AI tools with the need for methodological rigour?
9. What mechanisms should be established for sharing AI resources and expertise across institutions?
10. How can we ensure AI implementation in research aligns with existing clinical practice guidelines?
