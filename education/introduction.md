# Introduction

The advent of generative AI in physiotherapy education heralds a transformative era, bringing with it a host of opportunities to enhance learning experiences and outcomes. As we embrace this technological revolution, we find ourselves reimagining traditional educational paradigms. AI promises to deliver personalised learning pathways, create immersive simulations, and provide instant, tailored feedback to students. These advancements have the potential to deepen understanding, accelerate skill acquisition, and better prepare future physiotherapists for the complexities of clinical practice.

However, this digital shift also raises important questions about the preservation of hands-on skills, the maintenance of critical thinking abilities, clinical reasoning and the assurance of academic integrity. As we navigate this new educational landscape, we must carefully consider strategies that effectively integrate AI tools and promote their sustainable use, while safeguarding the core competencies and values of the physiotherapy profession. The challenge lies in striking a balance between technological innovation and the irreplaceable aspects of human mentorship and experiential learning.
